        Hey there! I'm Tomosori Ayomide Gabriel,
        <!-- I was born in the early 2000's. 
      I'm currently an undergraduate who finished school in the year, 2024. My dream course of study is computer Science  in Federal University of Technology, Minna.-->

        <!--<p>-->
        a passionate frontend web developer. I love turning ideas into reality
        and also crafting innovative solutions. I started web development in the
        year 2025, where I proceeded from the basics (HTML) to Javascript. I am
        very passionate when it comes to coding because it was borne out of a
        passion and desire to be one of the best web developers of my time. My
        designs are simply unique because they bear the handprint of success.
      </p>

        I have always found coding very interesting because it allows me to pour
        out my mind and skills in the creation of masterpieces. With the help of
        a mentor <span id="sirvic">"TECH PROVEE"</span> I was able to achieve my
        goal in my journey of programming. On a regular day when I'm not coding,
        you'll find me flipping or playing instruments.
